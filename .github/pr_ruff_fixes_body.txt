Applied ruff --fix (safe) across repository on branch ix/ruff-fixes. This commit fixes a large set of formatting and lint issues. Remaining issues reported by ruff include many undefined names, syntax errors (merge conflict markers), and larger code problems that need manual fixes. I propose to split follow-up fixes into smaller PRs by subsystem.

Notes:
- 1279 fixes applied automatically.
- 4376 ruff issues remain; many require manual/code changes beyond uff --fix.
- I recommend reviewing key failure categories (undefined logger uses, syntactic merge conflict artifacts, duplicate keyword args 'timeout', bare excepts, and E402 import order issues).

Next steps (if you approve):
1. Triage remaining issues, create small PRs per subsystem (e.g., scripts, phases, uai-license-api).
2. Fix merge conflict artifacts and syntax errors immediately (these block static analysis & tests).
3. Add CI gating to run ruff on PRs and require pre-commit.

This PR is large; opening as draft for review and iterative follow-up.
